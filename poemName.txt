Let Dew, house of Dew rejoice with Xanthenes a precious stone of an amber colour.

Let Round, house of Round rejoice with Myrmecites a gern having an Emmet in it.
The church bells toll a melancholy round,
Calling the people to some other prayers,
What freeman knoweth freedom? Never he
Whose father's father through long lives have reigned
O'er kingdoms which mere heritage attained.
Hail to thee, Cambria! for the unfettered wind
Which from thy wilds even now methinks I feel,
Here morning in the ploughman's songs is met
  Ere yet one footstep shows in all the sky,
